Prerequisites
- You must have two SOLIDserver appliances.
- The HA configuration can only be configured from and with two appliances using an IPv4 address or two appliances using an IPv6 address.
- The Master appliance should be configured locally as detailed in the section Configuring SOLIDserver to Remotely Manage Other Appliances.
- The future Hot Standby must be added to the page Centralized Management of the Master as detailed in the section Adding Remote Appliances.

Limitation
 - The database High Availability is configurable only for two appliances.
 - We strongly advise against displaying several HA configurations on the page Centralized Management. 
 - The HA does not support the configuration of a NAT between the two appliances.
 - If you encrypted the database, you cannot enroll a remote appliance as Hot Standby if the Active key of the local appliance, the future Master, is missing or corrupted


Keep in mind that for the configuration to be viable and effective the two appliances must:
 • Meet the prerequisites.
 • Be set at the same time. For more details, refer to the section Configuring NTP Servers.
 • Have the same version of SOLIDserver.
 • Have the same performance rate, to ensure a smooth transition. In the event of a switch, the former Hot Standby has retrieved all the database information and can actually provide the same performance and efficiency as the original Master.
 • Have the same architecture (32 bits or 64 bits).
